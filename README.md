<h1>Detecting Bollywood Actors</h1>

<h3>Auto Face Detection by camera and auto update on excel sheet</h3>

In this project, I have taken pictures of few actors & tested my Application. I used OpenCV to read the image file, face_recognition Package to detect the image, Numpy argmin to match the both images, datetime package to add the date time of the actor while detected.

<h2>Results - </h2>
<h3>In this Excel Sheet, Name of the Actor with Time when Detected<h3>
